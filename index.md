# [Beacon v2 Implementation Examples](https://beacon-project.io/implementations-v2/)

This page collects some use case documentation **during the Beacon v2 testing & refinement** process.
It is mainly thought to be a place for involved implementers and Beacon developers to get feedback
about their implementations, in essence with the aim to iron out inconsistencies in the protocol's
implementation or interpretation.

The pages can be accessed as [standard web pages](https://beacon-project.io/implementations-v2/).

Please add your individual project pages in this directory and link them here, following the
blueprint from the [Progenetix](progenetix-examples.md) page.

## Feedback

To provide feedback about the implementations please use this project's [**issues tracker**](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/implementations-v2/issues).
